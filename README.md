# WebGL Video Recorder unity package

This package allows you to record MP4 videos of HTML canvas elements, including those with WebGL contexts. It aims to support a wide range of real-world devices at interactive frame-rates.

## Importing VideoRecorder package into Unity

If you're using [Universal AR (UAR) Unity SDK](https://github.com/zappar-xr/universal-ar-unity) version 3.1.0 or above, you can directly add this package from Zappar menu option `Zappar > Additional Packages > Add\Update WebGL Video Recorder` (you may have to change focus of Editor Window or restart Unity after this if you see any error). Otherwise, you can import the package from the Unity editor by following these steps:
1. Opening the `Package Manager` from `Window > Package Manager` from Editor
2. Locate the `+` button on the top left corner and select `Add package from git URL...`
3. Enter the following URL: `https://github.com/zappar-xr/unity-webgl-video-recorder.git`

This will automatically fetch the latest version of the package from Github.

Another option is to add the `WebGL Video Recorder` package in your projects' `manifest.json` file located under `Root_Directory>Packages`.

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.zappar.videorecorder": "https://github.com/zappar-xr/unity-webgl-video-recorder.git"
  }
}
```

Note that you can modify the source Github URL to define any particular `tag`, `branch` or `commit hash`, by adding a suffix: `#ID` to the git URL. You can read more about it here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html

## Platform support

This library is currently supported only on Unity WebGL with the Unity version of `2021.x LTS` and above. There are placeholder APIs for editor mode development, but you would always need to build the project for testing any functionality.


## Usage

`ZVideoRecorder.cs` is the main script that exposes all the required APIs and callbacks you need to use the package. The typical flow of operation is as follows:
1. Register for VideoRecorder callbacks by calling `ZVideoRecorder.RegisterVideoRecorderCallbacks`, expecially for `OnRecorderReady` event. It might take couple of seconds for video recording plugin to initialize on mobile browsers.
2. Call the `ZVideoRecorder.Initialize(...)` with `ZVideoConfig` object which specifies the recorder properties. Normally you would call this from MonoBehaviours' `Awake` or `Start` method which will set up the library for use.
3. If not done already, then you may want to subscribe for `OnRecordingFinished` using the same `ZVideoRecorder.RegisterVideoRecorderCallbacks` method. Depending upon the unity canvas resolution and duration it might take some time for the plugin to process the video output after you've called to stop the video recording.
4. Call `ZVideoRecorder.StartRecording()` and `ZVideoRecorder.StopRecording()` to start/stop the recording process.
5. Unsubscribe from the plugin events by calling `ZVideoRecorder.DeregisterOnRecordingFinished(...)` as per your convenience.
6. Remeber to update your webgl template or final index.html to define `uarGameInstance`. Read [Updates to WebGL Template](#updates-to-webgl-template) section for details.

The package includes two example scenes to demonstrate the usage of the plugin. The `VideoRecorderSample.scene` uses the direct browser prompt to save the video recording at the end of processing, whereas the `VideoRecorderPromptSample.scene` uses the [com.zappar.sns](https://github.com/zappar-xr/unity-webgl-sns) package to open web prompt to check the recording and then either save or share it. Look for the `ZVidTest.cs` and `ZVidPromptTest.cs` scripts to understand the flow.


> **Note**: Make sure to uncomment all the lines containing `Zappar.Additional.SNS.ZSaveNShare` in `ZVidPromptTest.cs` when using VideoRecording package along with the SNS package, to allow calling the SNS APIs.


## Updates to WebGL Template

Lastly, to allow the plugin to send messages and events to the Unity game instance you would need to define uarGameInstance in the global window scope. Add the following line in the promise resolution state of the **createUnityInstance** method

`window.uarGameInstance=unityInstance;`

For example, in the default Unity WebGL template find the section where createUnityInstance method is called, and add this line inside the `.then((unityInstance)=> { ... })` block as follows:

```
createUnityInstance(canvas, config, (progress) => {
          progressBarFull.style.width = 100 * progress + "%";
        }).then((unityInstance) => {
          loadingBar.style.display = "none";
          window.uarGameInstance=unityInstance;
          fullscreenButton.onclick = () => {
            unityInstance.SetFullscreen(1);
          };
        }).catch((message) => {
          alert(message);
        });
```

You can define this inside your own WebGL Template or in the final `index.html` after the build.
